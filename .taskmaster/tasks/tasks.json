Tooling: Vite (faster dev server, simpler config) template: react-ts.\n2. Package manager: npm (already used in root/backend). Avoid mixing yarn/pnpm.\n3. Directory: d:/SIH-2.0/frontend (currently appears empty; will verify).\n4. TypeScript: Yes (future scalability, better DX for component libs).\n5. Aliases: Add '@' -> 'src' via vite.config.ts + tsconfig.json paths.\n6. ESLint/Prettier: Defer to later (could add when quality gating), keep initial scaffold minimal.\n7. Node version: Assume compatible (recommend >=18). Will not enforce via .nvmrc now.\n\nCommands (planned):\n1. cd frontend\n2. npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts\n3. npm install\n4. Configure path alias in vite.config.ts\n5. Update tsconfig.json compilerOptions.paths if needed\n6. Add sample component + verify dev server (npm run dev) – (manual validation step)\n\nPost-Scaffold Checklist:\n- package.json present with scripts (dev, build, preview, lint?).\n- tsconfig.tsconfig(app) includes strict flags (adjust only if necessary for Tailwind/shadcn later).\n- index.html loads root <div id=\"root\">.\n- main.tsx + App.tsx compile and run.\n- Alias '@' resolves after config change (create src/components/TestAlias.tsx import in App to prove path).\n\nEdge Considerations:\n- Windows path issues: use forward slashes in config.\n- Ensure no accidental nested folder creation (running vite inside existing non-empty folder is fine since empty).\n\nNext Subtasks Dependencies:\n- 5.2 Tailwind requires proper content globs; ensure src/**/*.{ts,tsx} baseline exists.\n- 5.3 shadcn requires Tailwind configured (so alias modifications should not break the CLI detection of tailwind.config.js later).\n\nValidation Plan:\n- After alias config, import a sample component using '@/components/Foo'.\n- Run dev server to ensure no module resolution errors.\n\nNo destructive operations planned. Ready to execute.\n</info added on 2025-09-02T23:03:41.854Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-02T23:08:05.106Z>\nProgress Update (2025-09-03):\n- Vite React TS scaffold created successfully in frontend/.\n- Added '@' alias via vite.config.ts + tsconfig.app.json (baseUrl + paths). Dev server confirms no module resolution errors; alias component renders.\n- Created TestAlias component imported via '@/components/TestAlias'.\n- Verified dev server runs at http://localhost:5173/ with expected UI + alias component block.\n- Ready to proceed to Tailwind configuration (Subtask 5.2).\n</info added on 2025-09-02T23:08:05.106Z>",

Install Dependencies:\n   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer\n2. Initialize Config Files:\n   npx tailwindcss init -p (creates tailwind.config.js + postcss.config.js)\n3. Configure Content Paths in tailwind.config.js:\n   content: [\n     './index.html',\n     './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'\n   ]\n4. (Optional) Theme Extensions (defer): custom colors, fontFamily.\n5. Add Tailwind Directives to src/index.css (top):\n   @tailwind base;\n   @tailwind components;\n   @tailwind utilities;\n6. Remove default scaffold styles (optional) from App.css if conflicting.\n7.

Import and test basic components or animations from each library to ensure they are functional.\n<info added on 2025-09-02T22:23:29.043Z>\nMagic UI + shadcn/ui Integration (Vite React + Tailwind context)\n\n1. Rationale:\n- Magic UI follows the same installation workflow as shadcn/ui; effectively we treat Magic UI components as remote component JSON specs consumed by the shadcn CLI.\n- This enables incremental adoption: only pull the components we actually need (tree-shakeable at compile time) rather than installing a large monolithic dependency.\n\n2. Prerequisites (after subtask 5.2 Tailwind setup):\n- Ensure Tailwind configured with content globs including: `./index.html`, `./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`\n- Ensure `tsconfig.json` has `baseUrl` set to `src` (optional) if you want `@/` import alias. If using alias, configure Vite:\n  // vite.config.ts\n  import path from 'path'\n  resolve: { alias: { '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src') } }\n\n3. Install Base Dependencies:\n```bash\n# From frontend directory\nnpm install framer-motion @radix-ui/react-slot class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge\n# If not already created by shadcn init\nnpm install lucide-react\n```\n\n4. Initialize shadcn/ui (works for non-Next Vite projects):\n```bash\nnpx shadcn@latest init\n```\nAnswer prompts:\n- Style: Default\n- Tailwind config path: tailwind.config.js (confirm)\n- Aliases: choose `@/` if using alias technique; else leave blank and adjust imports manually.\n\n5. Add Magic UI Component Example (Globe):\n```bash\nnpx shadcn@latest add \"https://magicui.design/r/globe.json\"\n```\nResult: A `globe.tsx` (or `globe.tsx` + supporting files) appears under `src/components/ui/` (path may vary with config). Import usage example:\n```tsx\nimport { Globe } from '@/components/ui/globe'\n\nexport function HeroGlobe() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"w-full flex justify-center py-12\">\n      <div className=\"h-[400px] w-[400px]\">\n        <Globe />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n6. Framer Motion Sanity Test:\nCreate `src/components/animation/FadeIn.tsx`:\n```tsx\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\nexport const FadeIn: React.FC<{delay?: number; className?: string}> = ({ children, delay = 0, className }) => (\n  <motion.div initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 8 }} animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }} transition={{ duration: 0.4, delay }} className={className}>\n    {children}\n  </motion.div>\n)\n```\nThen wrap a button or heading to verify animation.\n\n7. Minimal Validation Checklist:\n- `package.json` contains framer-motion + shadcn dependencies.\n- Tailwind classes render (e.g. add `bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500` test div).\n- Imported Magic UI component renders without TS errors.\n- Framer motion animation works.\n\n8. Optional Magic UI MCP (Installed):\n- Use the Magic UI MCP tool to enumerate available component JSON spec URLs and script adding multiple components in sequence. (Document chosen components: Globe, OrbitingCircles, AnimatedList, etc.)\n- Append chosen list to subtask notes for traceability.\n\n9. Optional Next.js Migration Note:\n- If later migrating to Next.js (App Router), shadcn/ui + Magic UI steps are identical; just re-run `init` with Next config and copy over `components/ui` contents. Confirm conflicting Tailwind config merges manually.\n\n10. Future Hardening:\n- Add ESLint + Prettier config early to keep generated components consistent.\n- Consider centralizing design tokens in `tailwind.config.js` theme extensions and referencing them in future Magic UI pulls.\n\nEdge Cases / Pitfalls:\n- Ensure the alias matches CLI prompt; mismatch causes incorrect import paths.\n- Vite needs restart after adding alias or new dependencies.\n- If component JSON introduces dynamic imports referencing next/image remove/adapt for Vite.\n</info added on 2025-09-02T22:23:29.043Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-02T23:37:14.298Z>\nExecution Plan (2025-09-03): Subtask 5.3 Install Component Libraries (shadcn/ui, Magic UI, Framer Motion, Supporting Utilities)\n\nObjective:\nEstablish a reusable, themeable UI foundation by installing and initializing shadcn/ui, integrating a sample Magic UI remote component, enabling animation primitives (Framer Motion), and adding utility libraries (class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge, Radix Slot, lucide icons) to support future tasks (layout, navigation, auth forms, and interactive features).\n\nContext & Preconditions:\n- Vite + React + TS project already scaffolded in `frontend/`.\n- Tailwind v4 working via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (validated in subtask 5.2).\n- Alias `@` → `src` available for clean imports.\n- `tailwind.config.js` present (will extend theme soon; keep minimal for now to avoid premature design lock-in).\n\nScope (Inclusions):\n- Install dependencies: framer-motion, @radix-ui/react-slot, class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge, lucide-react, (shadcn CLI if not present) shadcn-ui.\n- Initialize shadcn/ui to generate component directory structure.\n- Add at least one baseline shadcn primitive (e.g., button) to verify pipeline.\n- Import and render a remote Magic UI component (example: Globe) via `npx shadcn@latest add <url>` or CLI pattern; adapt path if it nests under `components/ui`.\n- Create a small animation helper component (`FadeIn`) using Framer Motion.\n- Wire at least one composed example into `App.tsx` (or a new `DemoShowcase.tsx`) to validate interplay among Tailwind utilities, shadcn styles, Magic UI component, and Framer Motion animation.\n- Provide dark mode toggle placeholder hook (optional stub) for future theming (NOT enabling full theme tokens yet—defer to after layout subtask unless trivial).\n\nOut of Scope (Deferrals):\n- Comprehensive theme token extension in `tailwind.config.js` (reserved for when we define brand tokens before Task 12 UI polish).\n- Global design tokens refactor (will come when more components accumulate).\n- Adding many Magic UI components (only 1 demo now to reduce noise; can batch later).\n\nDependency Rationale Summary:\n- shadcn/ui: Gives us headless + styled primitives consistent across tasks 6–12.\n- Magic UI (remote JSON spec): Quick infusion of visually engaging components (e.g., globe, animated lists) aligning with Landing Page & future animations.\n- Framer Motion: Required early to ensure components adopt animation patterns with minimal rewrites.\n- class-variance-authority + tailwind-merge + clsx: Standard pattern set for variant-driven styling + conflict-safe merging (makes new components consistent early).\n- @radix-ui/react-slot: Composition primitive used by many shadcn components.\n- lucide-react: Icon set (used widely across nav, forms, placeholders).\n\nCommands (Planned Sequence) [Run inside `frontend/`]:\n1. Install core UI deps:\n   npm install framer-motion @radix-ui/react-slot class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react\n2. (If CLI not present) Install shadcn CLI:\n   npx shadcn@latest init\n   # Accept defaults; confirm tailwind config path; choose alias '@/'.\n3. Add baseline components:\n   npx shadcn@latest add button card\n4. Add remote Magic UI component (example: Globe):\n   npx shadcn@latest add \"https://magicui.design/r/globe.json\"\n5. Create animation helper:\n   src/components/motion/FadeIn.tsx\n6. Integrate sample usage (either modify `App.tsx` or create `src/components/demo/UIShowcase.tsx`).\n7. Run dev server & visually verify: npm run dev\n8. (Optional) Build for production to ensure tree-shaking & no type errors: npm run build\n\nFile Additions / Edits:\n- New: `src/components/motion/FadeIn.tsx`\n- Modified: `src/App.tsx` (or add `src/components/demo/UIShowcase.tsx` and import into App)\n- Generated: `components/ui/*` via shadcn add commands (exact filenames determined by CLI).\n\nValidation Checklist:\n- Imports of Button/Card compile without TS errors.\n- Magic UI component renders (fallback placeholder if internal asset fetch fails).\n- Framer Motion animation executes (element fades in / upward translation resolved).\n- Lucide icon renders (e.g., <Search />) with applied Tailwind classes.\n- No runtime console errors; no missing dependency warnings.\n- `npm run build` completes without type or bundling errors (optional but recommended).\n\nEdge Cases & Mitigations:\n- CLI path globs: Ensure `tailwind.config.js` content globs already include `./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` (confirmed).\n- Tree-shaking / bundle bloat: Only add minimal components now—avoid mass import of all primitives.\n- Remote JSON network failure: If remote add fails, fallback to manual component add later; log attempt.\n- Dark mode: Provide stub toggler but do not finalize token design yet.\n\nFallback Plan:\n- If `shadcn@latest init` warns about unsupported environment, manually create `components/ui` directory and fetch raw component sources from repo (unlikely as Vite is supported pattern now).\n\nPost-Completion Log Content:\n- Record installed versions (from package.json diff).\n- Note any CLI prompts answered.\n- Capture confirmation of successful dev server render (screenshot reference optional textual summary).\n\nNext Subtasks Impact:\n- Subtask 5.4 (Layout + Navigation) will leverage Button + icon + motion + tokens base.\n- Placeholder components (5.5) reuse FadeIn + variant patterns; reduces duplication.\n</info added on 2025-09-02T23:37:14.298Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-02T23:46:57.695Z>\nProgress / Validation Log (2025-09-03): Subtask 5.3 Install Component Libraries\n\nStatus Summary:\n- Core UI dependencies installed: framer-motion, @radix-ui/react-slot, class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge, lucide-react.\n- shadcn CLI initialization failed due to repeated npm prompt cancellations. Applied fallback: manually scaffolded a `Button` component using `class-variance-authority` and `tailwind-merge` patterns.\n- Added utility helper `cn` for class merging and motion helper `FadeIn` for animations.\n- Integrated Lucide `Search` icon and composed demo variants in `App.tsx`.\n- Dev server started successfully (Vite re-optimized). Production build completed without errors: CSS 15.02 kB (gzip 3.65 kB), JS 330.52 kB (gzip 106.06 kB).\n\nEvidence Artifacts:\n- Added files: `src/components/ui/button.tsx`, `src/components/utils/cn.ts`, `src/components/motion/FadeIn.tsx`.\n- Modified: `src/App.tsx` (demo showcase with Button variants, FadeIn animation, and Lucide icon).\n- Build output verified: `dist/assets/index-*.css` includes button utility classes and gradient; no type errors.\n\nDeferred Item:\n- Magic UI remote component (Globe) not added due to shadcn CLI issues. Will attempt manual fetch or retry CLI after environment adjustments in a follow-up task.\n\nAcceptance Criteria Coverage:\n- Libraries present in `package.json`.\n- At least one primitive (Button) implemented with variant system.\n- Animation primitive (FadeIn) functional.\n- Icons rendering via lucide-react.\n- Utility-first styling intact (Tailwind v4 build validated).\n\nRisks / Follow-up:\n- Need to integrate shadcn CLI-generated components for consistency; manual approach is structurally compatible, minimizing migration cost.\n- Consider adding dark mode toggle and theme extension before Subtask 5.4 (Layout + Navigation) to reduce churn.\n\nNext Recommended Step:\nProceed to Subtask 5.4 (Layout + Navigation). Optionally create a mini-remediation task to acquire at least one Magic UI component once CLI issue is resolved.\n</info added on 2025-09-02T23:46:57.695Z>",

Decorative layers may be extracted into a reusable `<Backdrop />` component in the future if reused.\n- Marquee animation uses transform-based manual looping for low overhead; may switch to CSS animation for static content if needed. Current approach allows for fine-grained control and potential pause/resume triggers.\n- Reduced motion disables intervals and animation triggers by not mounting animation loops when `useReducedMotion()` returns true.\n</info added on 2025-09-03T01:07:03.554Z>",

Each meteor randomizes top/left, duration (4-8s), delay (0-6s), scale (0.4-1.0). Layer masked with radial gradient. Effect entirely skipped when `useReducedMotion()` returns true.  \n- Implemented shiny text effect using a gradient overlay pseudo-element with animated `shine` keyframe (3.5s loop). Provided CSS via inline `<style>` block due to arbitrary animation limitations; scoped to specific span using utility-like class pattern.  \n- Added smooth internal anchor scrolling (Learn More / Get Started) with JS interception only when not reduced motion. Falls back to native jump under reduced motion.  \n- Refined CTAs: added subtle hover background layer, consistent horizontal padding (`px-7`), group hover highlight. Maintained accessible focus rings.  \n- Prevented layout shifts by keeping all decorative elements absolutely positioned with no DOM reflow on animation.  \n- Added max-width for paragraph to improve readability (`max-w-2xl`).  \n- Introduced random meteor generation inside module; acceptable because deterministic reproducibility is not a requirement here. Could seed if needed.  \n\nPerformance & Accessibility Considerations:  \n- Meteors lightweight: only 7 spans; transform/opacity only animations.  \n- Keyframes only manipulate transform; no layout/paint heavy properties.  \n- Reduced motion disables: meteors, smooth scroll, leaving static hero.  \n- Contrast preserved; validated gradient text still readable due to underlying background contrast plus decorative only where text is masked (non-essential semantics preserved because actual text still present in DOM).  \n\nFollow-ups for potential refinement (optional):  \n- Replace inline `<style>` with a dedicated CSS file if repetition grows.  \n- Add meteor pausing on tab visibility change to save cycles (Page Visibility API) if perf budget tight.  \n- Provide user toggle for animations separate from OS setting if desired.\n</info added on 2025-09-03T01:11:57.342Z>",

Layout & Width: CTA container constrained with max-w-[56rem] (≤ 56rem) centered using existing utility container.\n2. Ripple Effect: Two layered absolutely positioned circular divs (blurred indigo tints) rotating via custom keyframes (ripple_5s linear infinite & reverse variant). Provided static radial gradient fallback when prefers-reduced-motion is active.\n3. Blur/Text Reveal: Implemented blurReveal variant (opacity:0+blur(8px) -> opacity:1+blur(0)) with 0.6s easeOut transition; disabled (static render) under reduced motion by skipping variant usage.\n4. Pulse Animation: Primary CTA anchor uses keyframes cta-pulse (scale 1→1.05→1) every 2s; animation is conditionally applied only if reduced motion not requested.\n5. Footer Structure: Semantic <footer> with visually hidden heading (sr-only) and three content groups (About paragraph, Contact nav/ul/li links, Social nav/ul/li links); responsive stack to single column on small screens through grid adjustments.\n6. Accessibility: All interactive links have visible text; focus-visible ring classes preserved; ripple layer marked aria-hidden; no icon-only links; color opacity chosen to avoid contrast loss.\n7. No Layout Shift: Decorative ripple elements absolutely positioned with fixed container; no DOM geometry changes at animation start.\n8. Reduced Motion: Ripple replaced by static gradient; pulse + blur reveal animations omitted (render final state) by gating variants and classes via useReducedMotion.\n\nPerformance Considerations:\n- Only transform/opacity/filter animated; no layout-affecting properties.\n- Limited keyframe complexity (simple rotation & scale).\n- Reused existing button styling to avoid duplicate CSS.\n\nBuild Validation:\n- Production build passed after unrelated animated-list alias & typing issues were fixed (bundle main JS ~361.40 kB before gzip, 114.99 kB gzip).\n- No TypeScript errors introduced by CTA/Footer changes.\n\nPotential Future Enhancements (Deferred):\n- Extract inline <style> keyframes to a global CSS module if reused elsewhere.\n- Add analytics hook to CTA click when analytics integration becomes in-scope.\n- Provide user-controlled animation toggle separate from OS preference.\n\nConclusion: All acceptance criteria satisfied; component behaves correctly with and without reduced motion; ready to mark subtask 6.6 as done.\n</info added on 2025-09-03T04:40:02.481Z>",

Remaining optional improvements deferred: a) consolidated error summary list with anchor links for screen reader navigation; b) real entropy-based strength meter (e.g., zxcvbn) with colored indicator; c) async username availability check placeholder; d) trimming and case normalization for username pre-submit (currently only zod sanitize).\n</info added on 2025-09-03T05:17:04.712Z>",

        "details": "Develop a Developer Dashboard Demo gated behind authentication, accessible only to logged-in users. Use shadcn/ui primitives to create a responsive 2-column layout with a sidebar navigation and main content area. Implement placeholder panels for future features (Aptitude Quiz, Course Information Display, Student Personal Academic Profile, Government College Directory snippet, Timeline Tracker snippet) with mock data and skeleton loaders. Include a global status/announcement area and ensure dark mode compatibility. Each feature panel should have a title, short description, and mock preview. Create a centralized mockData.ts file to export typed placeholder data for all features. Add TODO comments in each feature panel pointing to the real future task IDs (8, 9, 10, 11). Ensure basic accessibility with landmarks and aria-labels for navigation. Deliverables include DashboardLayout and SidebarNav components, individual feature placeholder components, route wiring in App.tsx, and a README snippet documenting the dev-only nature of the dashboard.",

Ensure placeholder panels display mock data correctly and include skeleton loaders. Check that navigation icons are functional and accessible. Confirm the dashboard is gated behind authentication and only visible to logged-in users. Validate the centralized mockData.ts file for accurate data typing and usage. Review the README snippet for clarity and completeness.",
