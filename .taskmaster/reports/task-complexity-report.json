		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Government College Directory",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks for frontend design, backend API development, data integration, and filtering functionality.",
			"reasoning": "The task requires both frontend and backend development, along with dynamic data handling and filtering, which increases complexity."
